Collation of all my favourite recipes from Anna Jones!

None of these recipes are my own, however, I figured what better way to showcase my HTML and CSS skills than putting together a collation of my favourite Anna Jones recipes. 

If anyone has any feedback that would be great - in particular, in this project there is a lot of repeated code and I think I could make good use of a framework such as Django to get rid of repeated code.
